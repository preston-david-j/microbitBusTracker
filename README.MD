This project allows you to use a Microbit V2 plugged into a PC to be used as a bus tracker!

Save stops to the microbit, and scroll through them with the left button.
Press the right button to find the next live ETA departures from the selected stop.
Press both buttons for a TTS version of the data!

To setup:
Have runner.py running in the background of the PC which the Microbit V2 is plugged into.
Copy all of the files within microbitFiles to a Microbit V2 with CODAL.
Create a file called key.txt, containing your BODS API Key.
